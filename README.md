## Overview

The Discord Support Bot is a sophisticated chatbot developed in TypeScript with the primary objective of offering support and addressing customer inquiries. A key feature integrated into this bot is the ##RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Model, which employs a Language Model (LLM) for answering user queries. Notably, the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model is utilized within this bot to deliver tailored responses by leveraging our extensive knowledge base. This ensures a customized and effective interaction with users seeking assistance.
